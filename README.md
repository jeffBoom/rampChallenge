## Jeff Dayton's Answer

- File 'step2Script.js' has my solution for finding the flag URL.
- The connectors folder has my 'flagConnector' which is how I retrieved the flag content.
- App.tsx contains the solution.


#### I would organize this very differently in production but figured this would be the easiest way to scan the solution.
